# Bonus question 1

- The algorithm discussed in Subsection-B3 has been used to create normalised length vs angle histograms for the given images
- Additionally as an experiment I animated a video of a launch point moving from one end of the picture 'scenario.png' to the other
- The output felt insightful hence I decided to share it in the final submission
- The images are named in the format  'name_img.png'
- The corresponding plots are named as 'name_plot.png'
- The script used to create the plots and images has also been shared
